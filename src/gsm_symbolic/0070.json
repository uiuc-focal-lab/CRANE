  "answer": "The builder works for 6 days every week and works for 4 weeks every month so he works for 6 days/week * 4 weeks/month = <<6*4=24>>24 days/month\nIf he earns $50 every day he then earns $50/day * 24 days/month = $<<50*24=1200>>1200/month\nA year is equal to 12 months so every year he earns $1200/month * 12 months/year = $<<1200*12=14400>>14400\n#### 14400",
