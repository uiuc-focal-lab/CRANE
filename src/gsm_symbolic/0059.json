  "question": "I have 10 liters of orange drink that are two-thirds water and I wish to add it to 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. But as I pour it, I spill one liter of the orange drink. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters?",
  "answer": "There are 15 x 3/5 = <<15*3/5=9>>9 liters of water from the 15 liters pineapple drink.\nAfter 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, there were 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 liters of orange drink left.\nOut of the 9 liters, 9 x 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 liters are water.\nThus, there are a total of 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 liters of water out of the 24 liters.\n#### 15",
