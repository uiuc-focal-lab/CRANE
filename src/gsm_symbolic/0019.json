  "answer": "The average and difficult questions comprises 100% - 40% = 60% of the quiz.\nThere are 60 questions x 40/100 = <<60*40/100=24>>24 easy questions.\nThere are a total of 60 questions x 60/100 = <<60*60/100=36>>36 average and difficult questions.\nIf Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, then this means she is sure of her 24 questions x 75/100 = <<24*75/100=18>>18 points.\nFrom the average and difficult questions, she is sure to get half of it correctly so that is 36 questions / 2 = <<36/2=18>>18 points.\nThus, she is sure of getting 18 points + 18 points = <<18+18=36>>36 points in her quiz.\n#### 36",
