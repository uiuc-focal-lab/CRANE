  "question": "Jackie is trying to decide whether to do her taxes herself or hire an accountant. If she does the taxes herself, she'll be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work, losing $35/hour in missed income. The accountant charges $90. How much more money will she have if she hires the accountant?",
  "answer": "First find the total lost revenue if Jackie does her taxes herself: $35/hour * 3 hours = $<<35*3=105>>105\nThen subtract the accountant's charge to find how much money Janet saves: $105 - $90 = $<<105-90=15>>15\n#### 15",
