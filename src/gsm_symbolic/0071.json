  "question": "Nate is feeding his livestock hay. Each goat needs 5 pounds, and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. If there are 15 goats and 12 sheep, how many pounds of hay does Nate need?",
  "answer": "First figure out how much hay each sheep needs: 5 pounds * 2 - 3 = <<5*2-3=7>>7 pounds/sheep\nNow figure out how much hay total the sheep need: 7 pounds/sheep * 12 sheep = <<7*12=84>>84 pounds\nNow figure out how much hay total the goats need: 5 pounds/goat * 15 goats = <<5*15=75>>75 pounds\nNow add the two amounts of hay to find the total: 84 pounds + 75 pounds = <<84+75=159>>159 pounds\n#### 159",
