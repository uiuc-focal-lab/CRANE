# Prover9 Binary Notes

Please note that in order for SynCode to successfully parse the LLM-generated PROVER9 completions, you need to copy the Prover9 folder from the LLM-Logic github page (https://github.com/teacherpeterpan/Logic-LLM/tree/main/models/symbolic_solvers/Prover9). The official Prover9 package from UNM is not compatible yet.
